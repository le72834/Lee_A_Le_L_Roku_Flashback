# Roku Flashback
The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to access three separate flashback features, movies, television and music. Each of these three section are comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 respectively. 
One of Flashback's main usability features is the demarcation of the user profile. Users will be divided into two distinct categories; administrators and Kids. Parents will have the ability to access all of Flashbacks' content and admin controls while 'Kids' will be limited to content pushed down from Flashbacks â€œkid-friendly content" protocol queries.
